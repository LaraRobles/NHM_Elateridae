Welcome to GitHub Repertory for MSc Thesis "Integrating ecological and phylogenetic approaches to uncover biodiversity and biogeographical influences in Mizoram: insights from Elateridae (Coleoptera)"


The present study applies an integrated ecological and phylogenetic framework to investigate Elateridae communities in Mizoram, assessing species richness, spatial variation, and potential endemicity. 
Using the SITE-100 standardised protocol, we combined morphospecies sorting, DNA barcoding, and phylogenetic analyses to:
(i) characterise community diversity and turnover across Mizoram sites; 
(ii) place Mizoram Elateridae within a global phylogenetic framework; 
(iii) assess the influence of biogeographical realms on Elateridae diversity and distribution; and 
(iv) provide a foundation for conservation strategies and a baseline for future research.
